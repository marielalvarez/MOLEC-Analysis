### Developed in python: 
- pandas for data cleansing
- matplotlib and seaborn for visuals
- scipy for normal distribution
- sklearn for Lasso regression
  
This project visualizes data from the MOLEC survey conducted by INEGI, focusing on the reading habits of Mexicans. The survey aims to explore the reality of reading in Mexico: its progress and areas of opportunity for the promotion of reading.

Through this analysis, we address the following research question: How does the development of reading habits during childhood influence their continuity into adulthood, and how is this related to the preference for physical or digital reading formats in the modern era?
